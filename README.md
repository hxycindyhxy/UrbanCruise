### 🏎️ UrbanCruise — A Modern Urban Car Rental Platform

UrbanCruise is a clean, user-friendly web app designed to simplify urban car rentals with style and ease. Built using vanilla JavaScript, JSON, and Node.js, this platform delivers an intuitive car browsing and reservation experience — from dynamic search and filtering to a smooth reservation workflow — all hosted on a cloud platform with seamless real-time updates.

### 📖 The Story Behind

UrbanCruise stands out by focusing on renting not just any cars, but carefully selected, fashionable vehicles that fit a contemporary urban lifestyle. The website itself mirrors this aesthetic through a sleek, modern design that’s both visually appealing and easy to navigate. It’s built for users who value style as much as convenience, helping them quickly find and book a car that matches their taste and needs — without the clutter or confusion of traditional rental sites.
